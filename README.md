In the scope of the Artificial Neural Networks course at Karab√ºk University's Department of Mechatronics Engineering, I conducted a project on 'Satellite Image Classification'.
 In this project, I utilized the Overhead Mnist dataset, which contains a total of 9,000 images distributed among 10 classes.

We achieved a success rate of 57% with the artificial neural network. We will continue our efforts to increase the success rate of the project.
